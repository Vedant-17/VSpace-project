This repository contains my internship project i.e. Dental Disease Prediction using Machine Learning.
Due to the client's privacy policy, I cannot share the dataset on this repository.
This project was developed using the KNN algorithm where a dataset of more than 3,000 X-rays was used to predict one of the seven most prevalent dental diseases.
